%The model we consider in this work has the following hypothesis. We 
%consider that mosquitoes are present in the medium and their presence has 
%an asymptotic growth. In many situations it has been considered that
%mosquitoes vary respect the climatological conditions. Moreover in some work 
%there has been studies where mosquitoes densities change periodically following 
%a periodic time dependent birth rate. However, our interest is to consider 
%the dynamics for the rain season for one year.
%
%	Our study focuses on a dengue outbreak that occurred on 2010 in the 
%city of Hermosillo. It was reported that in that year there was circulating one 
%serotype different from the 2. The presence of a second serotype was reported
%to occur on year 2011? However, as for 2010, there was a significant presence 
%of \ac{DHF} cases, it lead us to assume that 2010 was the year that serotype 2
%arrived to Hermosillo.
%
%	For our model we do not consider an exposed class. For our model a fraction 
%$\theta$ of the humans in class $S_1$ that are bitten by a mosquito of serotype 
%2 are the hemorrhagic cases. The rest of such cases belong to the classic
%version of the disease.
