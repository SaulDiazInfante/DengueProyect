  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose a debate on the role of 
  mathematical models in evaluating control strategies for vector-borne 
  infections. Mathematical models must have their complexity adjusted to their 
  goals, and we have basically two classes of models. At one extreme we have 
  models that are intended to check if our intuition about why a certain 
  phenomenon occurs is correct. At the other extreme, we have models whose 
  goals are to predict future outcomes. These models are necessarily very 
  complex. There are models in between these classes. Here we examine two 
  models, one of each class and study the possible pitfalls that may be 
  incurred. We begin by showing how to simplify the description of a 
  complicated model for a vector-borne infection. Next, we examine one example 
  found in a recent paper that illustrates the dangers of basing control 
  strategies on models without considering their limitations. The model in this 
  paper is of the second class. Following this, we review an interesting paper 
  (a model of the first class) that contains some biological assumptions that 
  are inappropriate for dengue but may apply to other vector-borne infections. 
  In conclusion, we list some misgivings about modelling presented in this 
  paper for debate.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Dengue is an emerging threat in the 
  U.S.-Mexico border region. Transmission has regularly occurred in Sonora, MX 
  since 1982 but it was not until 2014 that cities directly on the 
  Arizona-Sonora border had local transmission. One of the closest urban areas 
  to have regular seasonal transmission is Hermosillo, SN, MX. Developing a 
  better understanding of the knowledge and perceptions of dengue in close 
  geographic proximity to the border can identify areas to target for 
  prevention and control measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We 
  conducted focus groups in six neighborhoods in Hermosillo, SN, MX; three with 
  high-dengue transmission and three with lower transmission. Awareness of 
  dengue and experience with dengue was 
  common.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In all focus groups, discussants 
  reported knowing someone personally who had past dengue infection. We further 
  identified several key ways that the perceptions of dengue transmission could 
  influence the effectiveness of dengue control campaigns. First, there was 
  confusion about how dengue is transmitted. While people associated dengue 
  with mosquitoes, multiple modes of transmission were perceived including 
  direct person-to-person transmission. In one focus group, discussants 
  indicated a stigma surrounding dengue infection. The necessity to maintain 
  cleanliness in their households was identified as a primary strategy to fight 
  dengue; however, participants also noted the limited impact and their actions 
  may have on transmission if there is lack of community support or 
  governmental infrastructure to control neighboring and public 
  spaces.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: As dengue risk increases in the 
  border region, more efforts should be made to clearly convey the single mode 
  of transmission of dengue to avoid the development of stigma. More 
  coordinated efforts should be made to not only control but also prevent 
  dengue.},

  Abstract                 = {Dengue, a vector-borne disease, thrives in 
  tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. A retrospective analysis of the 
  2002 dengue epidemic in Colima located on the Mexican central Pacific coast 
  is carried out. We estimate the reproduction number from spatial epidemic 
  data at the level of municipalities using two different methods: (1) Using a 
  standard dengue epidemic model and assuming pure exponential initial epidemic 
  growth and (2) Fitting a more realistic epidemic model to the initial phase 
  of the dengue epidemic curve. Using Method I, we estimate an overall mean 
  reproduction number of 3.09 (95{\%} CI: 2.34,3.84) as well as local 
  reproduction numbers whose values range from 1.24 (1.15,1.33) to 4.22 
  (2.90,5.54). Using Method II, the overall mean reproduction number is 
  estimated to be 2.0 (1.75,2.23) and local reproduction numbers ranging from 
  0.49 (0.0,1.0) to 3.30 (1.63,4.97). Method I systematically overestimates the 
  reproduction number relative to the refined Method II, and hence it would 
  overestimate the intensity of interventions required for containment. 
  Moreover, optimal intervention with defined resources demands different 
  levels of locally tailored mitigation. Local epidemic peaks occur between the 
  24th and 35th week of the year, and correlate positively with the final local 
  epidemic sizes ($\rho$=0.92, P-value{\textless}0.001). Moreover, final local 
  epidemic sizes are found to be linearly related to the local population size 
  (P-value{\textless}0.001). This observation supports a roughly constant 
  number of female mosquitoes per person across urban and rural regions.},

  Abstract                 = {Although prior studies have investigated cellular 
  infection by dengue virus (DV), many have used highly passaged strains. We 
  have reassessed cellular infection by DV type 2 (DV2) using prototype and 
  low-passage isolates representing genotypes from different geographic areas. 
  We observed marked variation in the susceptibility to infection among cell 
  types by different DV2 strains. HepG2 hepatoma cells were susceptible to 
  infection by all DV2 strains assayed. Although the prototype strain generated 
  higher titers of secreted virus than the low-passage isolates, this 
  difference did not correspond to positive- or negative-strand viral RNA 
  levels and thus may reflect variation in efficiency among DV2 isolates to 
  translate viral proteins or package and/or secrete virus. In contrast, human 
  foreskin fibroblasts were susceptible to the prototype and low-passage Thai 
  isolates but not to five Nicaraguan strains tested, as reflected by the 
  absence of accumulation of negative-strand viral RNA, viral antigen, and 
  infectious virus. A similar pattern was observed with the antibody-dependent 
  pathway of infection. U937 and THP-1 myeloid cells and peripheral blood 
  monocytes were infected in the presence of enhancing antibodies by the 
  prototype strain but not by low-passage Nicaraguan isolates. Again, the 
  barrier appeared to be prior to negative-strand accumulation. Thus, depending 
  on the cell type and viral isolate, blocks that limit the production of 
  infectious virus in vitro may occur at distinct steps in the pathway of 
  cellular infection.},

  dengue virus (DENV) infections each year are clinically inapparent. People 
  with inapparent dengue virus infections are generally considered dead-end 
  hosts for transmission because they do not reach sufficiently high viremia 
  levels to infect mosquitoes. Here, we show that, despite their lower average 
  level of viremia, asymptomatic people can be infectious to mosquitoes. 
  Moreover, at a given level of viremia, DENV-infected people with no 
  detectable symptoms or before the onset of symptoms are significantly more 
  infectious to mosquitoes than people with symptomatic infections. Because 
  DENV viremic people without clinical symptoms may be exposed to more 
  mosquitoes through their undisrupted daily routines than sick people and 
  represent the bulk of DENV infections, our data indicate that they have the 
  potential to contribute significantly more to virus transmission to 
  mosquitoes than previously recognized.},

  Abstract                 = {Dengue virus, primarily transmitted by the Aedes 
  aegypti (L.) mosquito, has rapidly expanded in geographic ex- tent over the 
  past several decades. In some areas, however, dengue fever has not emerged 
  despite established Ae. aegypti populations. The reasons for this are unclear 
  and have sometimes been attributed to socio- economic differences. In 2013 we 
  compared Ae. aegypti adult density and population age structure between two 
  cities in Sonora, Mexico: Hermosillo, which has regular seasonal dengue virus 
  transmission, and Nogales, which has minimal transmission. Larval and pupal 
  abundance was greater in Nogales, and adult density was only higher in 
  Hermosillo during September. Population age structure, however, was 
  consistently older in Hermosillo. This difference in longevity may have been 
  one factor that limited dengue virus transmission in Nogales in 2013, as a 
  smaller proportion of Ae. aegypti females survived past the extrinsic 
  incubation period.},

  models the population dynamics of an SIR vector transmitted disease with two 
  pathogen strains. This model arose from our study of the population dynamics 
  of dengue fever. The dengue virus presents four serotypes each induces host 
  immunity but only certain degree of cross-immunity to heterologous serotypes. 
  Our model has been constructed to study both the epidemiological trends of 
  the disease and conditions that permit coexistence in competing strains. 
  Dengue is in the Americas an epidemic disease and our model reproduces this 
  kind of dynamics. We consider two viral strains and temporary cross-immunity. 
  Our analysis shows the existence of an unstable endemic state ('saddle' 
  point) that produces a long transient behavior where both dengue serotypes 
  cocirculate. Conditions for asymptotic stability of equilibria are discussed 
  supported by numerical simulations. We argue that the existence of 
  competitive exclusion in this system is product of the interplay between the 
  host superinfection process and frequency-dependent (vector to host) contact 
  rates.},

  Abstract                 = {The pacific islands of Micronesia have 
  experienced several outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases over the past 
  decade. Since these outbreaks occurred in confined island populations, their 
  analysis can improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the 
  pathogens involved, and particularly so for yet understudied pathogens such 
  as Zika virus. Here, we compare three outbreaks of dengue and Zika virus in 
  two different island settings in Micronesia, the Yap Main Islands and Fais, 
  using a mathematical model of transmission dynamics, making full use of 
  commonalities in disease and setting between the outbreaks. We found that the 
  estimated reproduction numbers for Zika and dengue are similar when 
  considered in the same setting, but that, conversely, reproduction number for 
  the same disease can vary considerably by setting. On the Yap Main Islands, 
  we estimate a mean reproduction number of 4.3 (95{\%} credible interval 
  3.1-6.1) for the dengue outbreak and 4.8 (2.9-8.1) for the Zika outbreak, 
  whereas for the dengue outbreak on Fais our mean estimate is 10 (5.5-18). We 
  further found that the ranges of most disease-specific parameters largely 
  overlap between dengue and Zika, but that reporting rates of Zika cases are 
  much smaller (3{\%}, 1-7) than those of dengue (68{\%}, 43-98). These results 
  suggests that models for dengue transmission can be useful for estimating the 
  predicted dynamics of Zika transmission, but care must be taken when 
  extrapolating findings from one setting to another. Field studies on 
  differences in vector density and biting exposure, as well as comparative 
  modelling studies in other settings, could yield important further insights 
  into the relationship between the transmission dynamics of Zika and dengue, 
  and the specific setting in which they occur.},

  to determine the joint formation sequence. However, their method does not

  demonstrated the sequential formation of orthogonal joints and noted the 
  difficulty of determining the formation sequence of joints at Y 
  intersections. Dengue viruses occur as four antigenically related but 
  distinct serotypes transmitted to humans byAedes aeglpti mosquitoes. These 
  viruses generally cause a benign syn-drome, dengue fever, in the American and 
  African tropics, and a severe syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock 
  syndrome (DHEF/DSS), in Southeast Asian chil-dren. This severe syndrome, 
  which recently has also been identified in children infected with the virus 
  in Puerto Rico, is characterized by increased vascular permeability and 
  abnormal hemostasis. It occurs in infants less than 1 year of age born to 
  dengue-immune mothers and in children 1 year and older who are immune to one 
  serotype of dengue virus and are experiencing infection with a second 
  serotype. Dengue viruses replicate in cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage, 
  and subneutraUlzing concentrations of dengue antibody enhance dengue virus 
  infection in these cells. This antibody-dependent enhance-ment of infection 
  regulates dengue disease in human beings, although disease severity may also 
  be controlled genetically, possibly by permitting and restricting the growth 
  of virus in monocytes. Monoclonal antibodies show heterogeneous distribution 
  of antigenic epitopes on dengue viruses. These epitopes serve to regulate 
  disease: when antibodies to shared antigens partially neutralize heterotypic 
  virus, infection and disease are dampened; enhancing antibodies alone result 
  in heightened disease response. Further knowledge of the structure of dengue 
  genomes should permit rapid advances in understanding the pathogenetic 
  mechanisms of dengue. War II, the rapid postwar growth of population and 
  urbanization, the deterioration in urban living environments, and global 
  economic downturns have contributed collectively to the spread of Aedes 
  aegypti and to the epidemic and endemic dispersal of the different dengue 
  serotypes (2). Dengue is a human disease of global significance. Up to 100 
  million cases of dengue infection per year worldwide can be estimated from 
  available data if one assumes there is an average annual infection rate of 
  10{\%} for endemic areas, with most suscepti-ble hosts being children (3). 
  Although dengue infections in children usually result in mild disease, a 1962 
  study in Bangkok suggested that more than half of the cases were of 
  sufficient severity to require medical attention (see 4). When Aedes aegypti

  Abstract                 = {Estimating the basic reproductive ratio R 0 of 
  dengue fever has continued to be an ever-increasing challenge among 
  epidemiologists. In this paper we propose two different constructions to 
  estimate R 0 which is derived from a dynamical system of host-vector dengue 
  transmission model. The construction is based on the original assumption that 
  in the early states of an epidemic the infected human compartment increases 
  exponentially at the same rate as the infected mosquito compartment (previous 
  work). In the first proposed construction, we modify previous works by 
  assuming that the rates of infection for mosquito and human compartments 
  might be different. In the second construction, we add an improvement by 
  including more realistic conditions in which the dynamics of an infected 
  human compartments are intervened by the dynamics of an infected mosquito 
  compartment, and vice versa. We apply our construction to the real dengue 
  epidemic data from SB Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, during the period of 
  outbreak Nov. 25, 2008–Dec. 2012. We also propose two scenarios to determine 
  the take-off rate of infection at the beginning of a dengue epidemic for 
  construction of the estimates of R 0 : scenario I from equation of new cases 
  of dengue with respect to time (daily) and scenario II from equation of new 
  cases of dengue with respect to cumulative number of new cases of dengue. The 
  results show that our first construction of R 0 accommodates the take-off 
  rate differences between mosquitoes and humans. Our second construction of 
  the R 0 estimation takes into account the presence of infective mosquitoes in 
  the early growth rate of infective humans and vice versa. We conclude that 
  the second approach is more realistic, compared with our first approach and 
  the previous work.},

  laboratory. Mortality was age-dependent and the marked cohorts had higher 
  survival rates than the untreated cohorts. Recapture rates of 13.0{\%} and

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Dengue, an infectious tropical 
  disease, has recently emerged as one of the most important mosquito-borne 
  viral diseases in the world. We perform a retrospective analysis of the 2011 
  dengue fever epidemic in Pakistan in order to assess the transmissibility of 
  the disease. We obtain estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0 from 
  epidemic data using different methodologies applied to different epidemic 
  models in order to evaluate the robustness of our estimate. RESULTS: We first 
  estimate model parameters by fitting a deterministic ODE vector-host model 
  for the transmission dynamics of single-strain dengue to the epidemic data, 
  using both a basic ordinary least squares (OLS) as well as a generalized 
  least squares (GLS) scheme. Moreover, we perform the same analysis for a 
  direct-transmission ODE model, thereby allowing us to compare our results 
  across different models. In addition, we formulate a direct-transmission 
  stochastic model for the transmission dynamics of dengue and obtain parameter 
  estimates for the stochastic model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
  methods. In each of the cases we have considered, the estimate for the basic 
  reproduction number R 0 is initially greater than unity leading to an 
  epidemic outbreak. However, control measures implemented several weeks after 
  the initial outbreak successfully reduce R 0 to less than unity, thus 
  resulting in disease elimination. Furthermore, it is observed that there is 
  strong agreement in our estimates for the pre-control value of R 0, both 
  across different methodologies as well across different models. However, 
  there are also significant differences between our estimates for the 
  post-control value of the basic reproduction number across the two different 
  models. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have obtained robust estimates for the 
  value of the basic reproduction number R 0 associated with the 2011 dengue 
  fever epidemic before the implementation of public health control measures. 
  Furthermore, we have shown that there is close agreement between our 
  estimates for the post-control value of R 0 across the different 
  methodologies. Nevertheless, there are also significant differences between 
  the estimates for the post-control value of R 0 across the two different 
  models.},

  Abstract                 = {Most studies on the ability of insect populations 
  to transmit pathogens consider only constant temperatures and do not account 
  for realistic daily temperature fluctuations that can impact vector-pathogen 
  interactions. Here, we show that diurnal temperature range (DTR) affects two 
  important parameters underlying dengue virus (DENV) transmission by Aedes 
  aegypti. In two independent experiments using different DENV serotypes, 
  mosquitoes were less susceptible to virus infection and died faster under 
  larger DTR around the same mean temperature. Large DTR (20 °C) decreased the 
  probability of midgut infection, but not duration of the virus extrinsic 
  incubation period (EIP), compared with moderate DTR (10 °C) or constant 
  temperature. A thermodynamic model predicted that at mean temperatures 
  {\textless}18 °C, DENV transmission increases as DTR increases, whereas at 
  mean temperatures {\textgreater}18 °C, larger DTR reduces DENV transmission. 
  The negative impact of DTR on Ae. aegypti survival indicates that large 
  temperature fluctuations will reduce the probability of vector survival 
  through EIP and expectation of infectious life. Seasonal variation in the 
  amplitude of daily temperature fluctuations helps to explain seasonal forcing 
  of DENV transmission at locations where average temperature does not vary 
  seasonally and mosquito abundance is not associated with dengue incidence. 
  Mosquitoes lived longer and were more likely to become infected under 
  moderate temperature fluctuations, which is typical of the high DENV 
  transmission season than under large temperature fluctuations, which is 
  typical of the low DENV transmission season. Our findings reveal the 
  importance of considering short-term temperature variations when studying 
  DENV transmission dynamics.},

  33, 36, and 39°C), selected on the basis of historical temperature tendencies

  -0.086°C/year. These projected increases will result in temperatures 
  favorable to the Ae. aegypti life cycle, causing rapid population growth. 
  Therefore, Ae. aegypti populations are likely to expand in the mesoregions

  that in all cases R0 {\textgreater}1. We demonstrate that an outbreak is 
  possible, even in cases where R0 is less than one, provided that the 
  vector-to-human component of R0 is greater than one and that a certain number 
  of infected vectors are introduced into the affected population. This theory 
  is applied to two real epidemiological dengue situations in the southeastern 
  part of Brazil, one where R0 is less than one, and other one where R0 is 
  greater than one. In both cases, the model mirrors the real situations with 
  reasonable accuracy.},

  heavily on the use of chemical insecticides. However, concerns about the 
  efficiency of traditional control methods, environmental impact and emerging 
  pesticide resistance have highlighted the necessity for developing innovative 
  tools for mosquito control. Some novel strategies, including release of 
  insects carrying a dominant lethal gene (RIDL{\textregistered}), rely on the 
  sustained release of modified male mosquitoes and therefore benefit from a 
  thorough understanding of the biology of the male of the species. In this 
  report we present the results of a mark-release-recapture study aimed at: (i) 
  establishing the survival in the field of laboratory-reared, wild-type male 
  Aedes aegypti and (b) estimating the size of the local adult Ae. aegypti 
  population. The study took place in Panama, a country where recent increases 
  in the incidence and severity of dengue cases have prompted health 
  authorities to evaluate alternative strategies for vector control. Results 
  suggest a life expectancy of 2.3 days for released male mosquitoes 
  (confidence interval: 1.78-2.86). Overall, the male mosquito population was 
  estimated at 58 males/ha (range 12-81 males/ha), which can be extrapolated to 
  an average of 0.64 pupae/person for the study area. The practical 
  implications of these results are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The rapid spread of dengue is a worldwide public health problem. In two clinical studies of
dengue in Managua, Nicaragua, we observed an abrupt increase in disease severity across several
epidemic seasons of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) transmission. Waning DENV-1 immunity
appeared to increase the risk of severe disease in subsequent DENV-2 infections after a period of
cross-protection. The increase in severity coincided with replacement of the Asian/American
DENV-2 NI-1 clade with a new virus clade, NI-2B. In vitro analyses of viral isolates from the two
clades and analysis of viremia in patient blood samples support the emergence of a fitter virus in
later, relative to earlier, epidemic seasons. In addition, the NI-1 clade of viruses was more virulent
specifically in children who were immune to DENV-1, while DENV-3 immunity was associated
with more severe disease among NI-2B infections. Our data demonstrate that the complex
interaction between viral genetics and population dynamics of serotype-specific immunity
contribute to the risk of severe dengue disease. Furthermore, this work provides insights into viral
evolution and the interaction between viral and immunological determinants of viral fitness and
virulence.},

  several ways. For example, from the stability analysis of a compartmental 
  model; through the use of the matrix of next generation, or from the final 
  size of an epidemic, etc. In this paper we applied the method for estimating 
  R0 of dengue fever from the initial growth phase of an outbreak, without 
  assuming exponential growth of cases, a common assumption in many studies. We 
  used three different methods of calculating R0 to compare the techniques' 
  details and to evaluate how these techniques estimate the value of R0 of 
  dengue using data from the city of Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto (SE of Brazil) in two 
  outbreaks. The results of the three methods are numerically different but, 
  when we compare them using a system of differential equations developed for 
  modeling only the first generation time, we can observe that the methods 
  differ little in the initial growth phase. We conclude that the methods 
  predict that dengue will spread in the city studied and the analysis of the 
  data shows that the estimated values of R0 have an equal pattern overtime.},

From 3,185 children randomly sampled in schools and households, the population prevalence of neutralizing antibody to the tour dengue serotypes was estimated. To estimate the Incidence of infection with each dengue virus serotype (dengue seroconversions), first grade children were re-bled in January 1981 (cohort study). Children admitted to hospital were studied for dengue virus isolation and antibody responses in paired sera. An epidemic of dengue occurred in 1980. Plaque reduction neutralization tests of 1,009 pre-epidemic sera from children aged <1–10 years of age determined that 3.3$\%$ were immune to dengue 1, 13.2$\%$ to dengue 2, 6.4$\%$ to dengue 3, and 5.8$\%$ to dengue 4. Examination of pre- and post-epidemic cohort blood samples revealed that the incidence of dengue Infection in 251 seronegative children was 39.4$\%$ (15.1$\%$ dengue 1, 11.1$\%$ dengue 2, 2.0$\%$ dengue 3, 4.8$\%$ dengue 4, and 6.4$\%$ two or more dengue viruses). Among the 52,935 residents of the study area, there were 22 cases of virologically and clinically confirmed dengue shock syndrome, in children 15 years or younger. All 22 shock syndrome cases had secondary type antibody responses. Eight of 22 had been included in the random serologic sample prior to onset of shock; five had been immune to dengue 1, two to dengue 3, one to dengue 4, and none to dengue 2. Despite the high rate of dengue 1 infectione In 1980, only dengue 2 viruses were recovered from dengue shock syndrome cases, including two dengue 1 Immune children with pre-illness serum specimens. Although the pre-epidemic prevalence of antibodies to dengue 1 was the lowest to any type, children with this Immunologic background contributed disproportionately to shock cases. In descending order of magnitude, risk factors for dengue shock syndrome in Rayong were secondary infections with dengue 2 which followed primary infections with dengue 1, dengue 3, or dengue 4.},

  laboratory study in which 166 mosquitoes imbibed two blood meals at known 
  intervals. Eighty percent (78/98) of the multiple meals were detected when 
  the interval between meals was from 1 to {\textless} to = 24 h and the time 
  from the second meal to fixation ranged from 0 to 12 hr. At intervals outside 
  this range, only 34{\%} (23/68) of the multiple meals were detected. Overall, 
  61{\%} (101/166) of the double meals were detected. Examination of 96 
  engorged Ae. aegypti collected by aspiration from inside houses in San Juan, 
  Puerto Rico, indicated that 50{\%} had imbibed multiple meals. Most 
  wild-caught mosquitoes took their last meal the day before capture, and most 
  multiple feeders fed twice on consecutive days. A dark line of digested 
  blood, or heme, around the first meal and a physical separation between meals 
  were the most useful histologic parameters for detecting multiple feeding in 
  wild Ae. aegypti. An association of multiple feeding with advanced stages of 
  oocyte development suggests that, at the time of collection, most Ae. aegypti 
  from the study site had fed twice in each gonotrophic cycle. We conclude 
  that, although it is labor intensive, histologic examination is an 
  appropriate technique for a longitudinal, community-wide survey of multiple 
  feeding by Ae. aegypti.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a mathematical model to closely mimic 
  the integrated program of impulsive vector control (every Friday afternoon 
  since the initiation of the program) and continuous patient treatment and 
  isolation implemented in the Guangdong Province of China during its 2014 
  dengue outbreak. We fitted the data of accumulated infections and used the 
  parameterized model to carry out a retrospective analysis to estimate the 
  basic reproduction number 1.7425 (95{\%} CI 1.4443–2.0408), the control 
  reproduction number 0.1709, and the mosquito-killing ratios 0.1978, 0.2987, 
  0.6158 and 0.5571 on October 3, 10, 17 and 24, respectively. This suggests 
  that integrated intervention is highly effective in controlling the dengue 
  outbreak. We also simulated outbreak outcomes under different variations of 
  the implemented interventions. We showed that skipping one Friday for vector 
  control would not result in raising the control reproduction number to the 
  threshold value 1 but would lead to significant increase in the accumulated 
  infections at the end of the outbreak. The findings indicate that quick and 
  persistent impulsive implementation of vector control result in an effective 
  reduction in the control reproduction number and hence lead to significant 
  decline of new infections.},

  fluctuation or by analyzing the boundary flow for acyclicity with point 
  dissipativity being only required in a neighborhood of the boundary. The 
  approach is illustrated for a model describing the spread of a fatal

  Abstract                 = {Background In 2015, the Zika arbovirus (ZIKV) 
  began circulating in the Americas, rapidly expanding its global geographic 
  range in explosive outbreaks. Unusual among mosquito-borne diseases, ZIKV has 
  been shown to also be sexually transmitted, although sustained autochthonous 
  transmission due to sexual transmission alone has not been observed, 
  indicating the reproduction number (R0) for sexual transmission alone is less 
  than 1. Critical to the assessment of outbreak risk, estimation of the 
  potential attack rates, and assessment of control measures, are estimates of 
  the basic reproduction number, R0. Methods We estimated the R0 of the 2015 
  ZIKV outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, through an analysis of the 
  exponential rise in clinically identified ZIKV cases (n = 359 to the end of 
  November, 2015). Findings The rate of exponential rise in cases was ?? = 
  0.076 days???1, with 95{\%} CI [0.066,0.087] days???1. We used a vector-borne 
  disease model with additional direct transmission to estimate the R0; 
  assuming the R0 of sexual transmission alone is less than 1, we estimated the 
  total R0 = 3.8 [2.4,5.6], and that the fraction of cases due to sexual 
  transmission was 0.23 [0.01,0.47] with 95{\%} confidence. Interpretation This 
  is among the first estimates of R0 for a ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, and 
  also among the first quantifications of the relative impact of sexual 
  transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES:Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is an 
  important cause of morbidity in South-east Asia and used to occur almost 
  exclusively in young children. In recent years, there has been a progressive 
  shift in age-distribution towards older children and adults. We investigated 
  an outbreak in 2001 in both children and adults, in an endemic area of 
  Thailand.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:Retrospective study of 347 
  patients with serologically confirmed dengue infection admitted to Chonburi 
  Hospital during an epidemic in 2001.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:A total 
  of 128 (37{\%}) patients had dengue fever (DF) and 219 (63{\%}) had DHF. 
  Patients with DHF were significantly older than patients with DF (11 years 
  vs. 8 years). Clinical bleeding was noted in 124 individuals, both with DF (n 
  = 24) and DHF (n = 100), and significantly more frequently in adults. 
  Twenty-nine (13.2{\%}) of all DHF cases were caused by primary infection. 
  Secondary dengue infection was associated significantly with the development 
  of DHF in children, OR (95{\%} CI) = 3.63 (1.94-6.82), P {\textless} 0.0001, 
  but not in adults, OR (95{\%} CI) = 0.6 (0.02-6.04), P = 1. Unusual clinical 
  manifestations were observed in 23 patients: three presented with 
  encephalopathy and 20 with highly elevated liver-enzymes. In the latter 
  group, four patients were icteric and nine had gastrointestinal 
  bleeding.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:These results indicate that DHF 
  in South-east Asia is common in both children and adults. In dengue-endemic 
  countries, dengue should be considered as a differential diagnosis in 
  patients with clinical gastrointestinal bleeding in association with 
  increased liver enzymes.},

Ces donn{\'e}es ont {\'e}t{\'e} analys{\'e}es dans l'optique de d{\'e}terminer si, dans les infections inapparentes humaines {\`a} arbovirus, la vir{\'e}mie pouvait {\^e}tre suffisante pour constituer un risque r{\'e}el d'introduction de ces infections dans des r{\'e}gions jusque-l{\`a} indemnes. Au cours des {\'e}pid{\'e}mies de dengue et d'infections {\`a} virus chikungunya (CHIKV), on pense que l'Homme est le seul h{\^o}te vert{\'e}br{\'e} concern{\'e}. Puisqu'un tr{\`e}s grand nombre d'individus sont infect{\'e}s et puisque les taux de vir{\'e}mie varient consid{\'e}rablement chez les malades symptomatiques, il est raisonnable de penser que, dans un certain nombre de formes inapparentes, le taux de vir{\'e}mie pourrait {\^e}tre suffisant pour infecter des moustiques comp{\'e}tents. Par ailleurs, dans la dengue et les infections {\`a} CHIKV, des infections nosocomiales ont {\'e}t{\'e} identifi{\'e}es, repr{\'e}sentant un mode alternatif d'introduction des virus dans des r{\'e}gions indemnes. Dans les arboviroses zoonotiques transmises par des moustiques comme l'enc{\'e}phalite japonaise ou les infections {\`a} virus West Nile (WNV), la situation est bien diff{\'e}rente puisque l'Homme est consid{\'e}r{\'e} comme une impasse {\'e}pid{\'e}miologique. Toutefois, si l'on tient compte du tr{\`e}s grand nombre de formes inapparentes survenant chez l'Homme au cours des {\'e}pid{\'e}mies et de l'existence de modes de contamination nouveaux r{\'e}cemment identifi{\'e}s (transfusion sanguine, greffe d'organes, voie transplacentaire), l'introduction de ces arboviroses peut ainsi {\^e}tre assur{\'e}e dans des r{\'e}gions jusque-l{\`a} {\'e}pargn{\'e}es.},

  abstract = {In dengue virus infections the asymptomatic cases are much more frequent than the symptomatic ones, but their true role in the introduction  and subsequent spread of dengue viruses in non-endemic regions remains to de clarified. We analysed data from English and French literatures to assess if viraemia in asymptomatic dengue infections might be sufficient to represent a true risk. During outbreaks of dengue a large number of individuals are infected and since viraemia levels in symptomatic patients are known to vary by many orders of magnitude, it is reasonable to augur that a proportion of asymptomatic cases might reach levels of viraemia sufficient to infect competent mosquitoes. In addition, a number of new ways of contamination in man by dengue viruses were recently described such as blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation and nosocomial  infections that may be worth considering.},
