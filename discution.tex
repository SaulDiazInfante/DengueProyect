\paragraph{In the Discussion-Conclusions it is essential to:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        be clear what YOU did and what other authors have done
    \item
        highlight your UNIQUE contribution
    
    \item
        discuss LIMITATIONS of your findings state what the
         applications and implications of your research are
\end{itemize}

The Discussion should answer the following questions, and possibly in the follow-
ing order. You can thus use the answers to structure your Discussion. This gives you
a relatively easy template to follow.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        What are my most important findings?
    \item
        Do these findings support what I set out to demonstrate at the beginning of the
        paper?
    \item
        How do my findings compare with what others have found? How consistent are
        they?
    \item
        What is my personal interpretation of my findings?
    \item
        What other possible interpretations are there?
    \item
        What are the limitations of my study? What other factors could have influenced
        my findings? Have I reported everything that could make my fi ndings invalid?
    \item
        Do any of the interpretations reveal a possible flaw (i.e. defect, error) in my
        experiment?
    \item
        Do my interpretations contribute some new understanding of the problem that I
        have investigated? In which case do they suggest a shortcoming in, or an
        advance on, the work of others?
    \item
        What external validity do my findings have? How could my findings be 
        generalized to other areas?
    \item
        What possible implications or applications do my fi ndings have? What support
        can I give for such implications?
    \item
        What further research would be needed to explain the issues raised by my 
        findings? Will I do this research myself or do I want to throw it open to the
        community?
\end{enumerate}
A JBM structure for discussion:
    \paragraph{Statement of principal findings}
        The central hypotheses of this manuscript were:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item
                strain DENV-II circulated in the 2010 Hermosillo 
            \item
                Dengue outbreak antibody-Dependent Enhancement hypothesis
                could explain the HDF high incidence 
            \item
                unconfirmed cases represent almost 95 \% of the total
                incidence.
        \end{itemize}
    With these hypotheses, we formulated a model that describes
    the incidence dynamics of HDF cases of the 2010 Hemosillo outbreak.
    Our parameters estimation does not reject these hypothesis and provide
    statistical evidence that the concerning reproductive number was 2.47.
    

    \paragraph{Strengths and weaknesses of the study}
        We believe this is the first attempt to fit the exponential 
    growth of the incidence according to the Hemorragic Dengue Disease. 
    Further, the strucutre of our R0 calcuoation results be 
    the gemetric mean of to expresion that are closed related 
    with the parameters transmition according to the Hemorragic.  

    
        However, our formulation only considers an outbreak of one season.
    Thus classical asymptotic analysis has mathematical consistency
    but lacks biological meaning.  In this line, we are preparing a
    version that achieves both \textemdash proper data fitting and consistent
    asymptotic behavior. We believe that adding a class of immunity
    according to the particular strain would be an option.

    \paragraph{Strengths and weaknesses in relation 
        to other studies, discussing important
        differences in results}
        
        We apply the idea of an index of strain susceptibility as in [1,2,3] 
    to modulates the propensity to acquire Dengue due to a given serotype.  Thus,
    combining the hypothesis of unreported incidence [3,4,5], we achieve
    proper data fitting.

        Our contribution describes scenarios wherein past Dengue outbreaks
    detected a dominant strain. Then decision-makers could project new
    dengue strain invasion scenarios.

        The cause of HDF is still unclear; for example, in [6] reports that
    the concentration of the virus explains the severity of Dengue. In
    this direction, Gomez et al. report a model that considers a severity
    stratification according to the mosquito load virulence.

        In short, we believe that early serotype identification in any Dengue
    outbreak would be essential infromation to make epidemiological decisions.
