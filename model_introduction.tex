%\paragraph{Introduction}
    Our work aims to explain the \ac{DHF} cases reported in the Hermosillo's 
2010 outbreak. Thus, our formulation only considers the time of the epidemic and
supposes that at this period, the \ac{DENV-2} serotype invades for the first 
time the city. We understand the\ac{DHF} cases as a consequence of reinfection 
with the \ac{DENV-2} serotype. That is, a fraction of individuals with immunity 
to serotype \ac{DENV-1}\textemdash acquired by past outbreaks\textemdash 
increments their susceptibility to the \ac{DENV-2}, and consequently 
develops hemorrhagic with a certain probability.
