## About the Journal

*Formerly the IMA Journal of Mathematics Applied in Medicine and Biology.*

*Mathematical Medicine and Biology* publishes original articles with a significant mathematical content addressing topics in medicine and biology. Papers exploiting modern developments in applied mathematics are particularly welcome. The biomedical relevance of mathematical models should be demonstrated clearly and validation by comparison against experiment is strongly encouraged.

The journal welcomes contributions relevant to any area of the life sciences including:

- biomechanics
- biophysics
- cell biology
- developmental biology
- ecology and the environment
- epidemiology
- immunology
- infectious diseases
- neuroscience
- pharmacology
- physiology
- population biology

# Acta Tropica (2.629)
Acta Tropica, is an international journal on infectious diseases that covers public health sciences and biomedical research with particular emphasis on topics relevant to human and animal health in the tropics and the subtropics.

Its scope includes the biology of pathogens and vectors, host-parasite relationships, mechanisms of pathogenicity, clinical disease and treatment, and we welcome contributions in basic or applied research in disciplines such as epidemiology, disease ecology, diagnostics, interventions and control, mathematical modeling, public health and social sciences, climate change, parasite and vector taxonomy, host and parasite genomics, biochemistry and immunology and vaccine testing.

Only manuscripts of high scientific significance and innovation will be considered for publication. Manuscripts of minimal international relevance, case reports, and control strategies at very early inconclusive laboratory stages of development will not be considered for publication.
-Matches the scientific scope of the journal,
-Presents results that significantly advance science including innovative new approaches,
-Meets quality standards of presentation and literature citation,
-Demonstrates potential health or biomedical impact.

# Infection, Genetics and Evolution (2.611)
## Journal of Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases (MEEGID)
Editor-in-Chief: Michel Tibayrenc

Infectious diseases constitute one of the main challenges to medical science in the coming century. The impressive development of molecular megatechnologies and of bioinformatics have greatly increased our knowledge of the evolution, transmission and pathogenicity of infectious diseases. Research has shown that host susceptibility to many infectious diseases has a genetic basis. Furthermore, much is now known on the molecular epidemiology, evolution and virulence of pathogenic agents, as well as their resistance to drugs, vaccines, and antibiotics. Equally, research on the genetics of disease vectors has greatly improved our understanding of their systematics, has increased our capacity to identify target populations for control or intervention, and has provided detailed information on the mechanisms of insecticide resistance.

However, the genetics and evolutionary biology of hosts, pathogens and vectors have tended to develop as three separate fields of research. This artificial compartmentalisation is of concern due to our growing appreciation of the strong coevolutionary interactions among hosts, pathogens and vectors.

Infection, Genetics and Evolution and its companion congress MEEGID (for Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases) are the main forum acting for the cross-fertilization between evolutionary science and biomedical research on infectious diseases.

Infection, Genetics and Evolution is the only journal that welcomes articles dealing with the genetics and evolutionary biology of hosts, pathogens and vectors, and coevolution processes among them in relation to infection and disease manifestation. All infectious models enter the scope of the journal, including pathogens of humans, animals and plants, either parasites, fungi, bacteria, viruses or prions. The journal welcomes articles dealing with genetics, population genetics, genomics, postgenomics, gene expression, evolutionary biology, population dynamics, mathematical modeling and bioinformatics. We also provide many author benefits, such as free PDFs, a liberal copyright policy, special discounts on Elsevier publications and much more.

# Theoretical Population Biology (1.559)
An interdisciplinary journal, Theoretical Population Biology presents articles on theoretical aspects of the biology of populations, particularly in the areas of demography, ecology, epidemiology, evolution, and genetics. Emphasis is on the development of mathematical theory and models that enhance the understanding of biological phenomena.

Articles highlight the motivation and significance of the work for advancing progress in biology, relying on a substantial mathematical effort to obtain biological insight. The journal also presents empirical results and computational and statistical methods directly impinging on theoretical problems in population biology.

Further elaboration on the aims and scope of the journal appears in an editorial.
