            In this work we have presented a mathematical model to
    understand the 2010  dengue outbreak that occurred in Hermosillo,
    Mexico. The model includes  infected classes of classic and
    hemorrhagic versions of dengue in order to  adjust the observed data.
    To our knowledge, there is no published work
