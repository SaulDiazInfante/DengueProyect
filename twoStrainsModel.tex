\section*{Important Hypothesis (Daniel-Saúl)}
	\paragraph{Permanent immunity}
	Accordingly to \cite{WHO}, infection of Dengue caused by a serotype DEN-i
	induces long-life immunity to reinfection with this strain. Then, we
	assume in our formulation that a susceptible individual previously
	infected with Dengue of serotype DEN-i only could acquire Dengue of a 
	different serotype.  We also suppose that a susceptible individual who 
	never get infected before, could obtain Dengue by any of serotypes 
	DENV-1, or DENV-2, but only for a single time and during the outbreak 
	period.
%
	\paragraph{ADE hypothesis}
	The processes and factors that produce \ac{DHF} are still unclear. There is 
	evidence that reinfection with a different serotype enhances the probability 
	of developing plasma vascular permeability---the \ac{ADE} hypothesis 
	\citep[see, e.g.][p. 295]{Halstead1992}. 
	But there also exist studies that report first infection DHF cases 
	\cite{Debast1993}. We consider in our formulation the ADE hypothesis, that 
	is, only a fraction of the second reinfection with serotype \ac{DENV-2} 
	develops vascular leaking.
%
\paragraph{\ac{DENV-2} report circulation in Hermosillo}
According to \cite{Vazquez2011} and \cite{Reyes2017}, in year 2010 only DENV-1 was present in the state of Sonora. Based on this information it is not clear that reinfection with a second strain in 2010 is the main cause of DHF. However, contrary to these studies, one of the main hypothesis in this work is that DENV-2 was present in Sonora in 2010. Our hypothesis is based on previous experiences, just as mentioned in \cite{Gomez2014}. In this work, where the authors analyze the dengue situation in Mexico for the period 2000 to 2011, argue that the increase of DHF in 2001 in Yucatan was linked to the introduction of the DENV-2 strain. Therefore, part of our hypothesis is that in 2010 there was an introduction of the DENV-2 into the Sonora state. 

\paragraph{Asymptomatic and reported cases}


We assume that the $95\%$ (pendiente) of the \ac{DCF} are asymptomatic, whereas for 
\ac{DHF}  all the cases are reported. Therefore, the class $Y_{-1}^{[h]}$ accounts for
all the \ac{DHF} cases, whereas a fraction $p=0.05$ of the sum $I_1+ I_2 + 
Y_{-1}^{[c]}$ represent the confirmed cases of \ac{DCF}.

\paragraph{Homogeneity about the early outbreak stage}

Define the infection forces as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		A_{I_1} &=
			\frac{\beta_Mb}{N_H} I_1, \qquad
		A_{I_2}=
			\frac{\beta_Mb}{N_H} I_2,
	\\
		A_{Y_{-1}^{[h]}}&=
		\frac{\beta_Mb}{N_H} Y_{-1} ^{[h]}, \qquad
		A_{Y_{-1}^{[c]}}=
			\frac{\beta_Mb}{N_H} Y_{-1}^{[c]},
	\\
		B_{M_1} &= 
			\frac{\beta_Hb}{N_H}M_1, \qquad
		B_{M_2}=
			\frac{\beta_Hb}{N_H}M_2 ~.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\paragraph{Vector transmission dynamics}
Define
$$
	A_{\bullet}:=
		A_{I_1} + A_{I_2} + A_{Y_{-1}^{[h]}} + 
		A_{Y_{-1}^{[c]}}
$$
as the total human infection force, that is, 
the sum of all
human contributions to the vector infection. 
Then we describe the mosquito disease dynamics 
by 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\\
		\frac{dM_S}{dt}&=
			\Lambda_M
			- A_{\bullet} M_S
			- \mu_M M_S
		\\
		\frac{dM_1}{dt}&=
			A_{I_1}  M_S - \mu_M M_1
		\\
		\frac{dM_2}{dt} &=
			\left(
				A_{I_2}+A_{Y_{-1}^{[h]}}+A_{Y_{-1}^{[c]}}
			\right) 
			M_S-\mu_M M_2
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here $M_S$, is the vector susceptible class and
$M_1$, $M_2$ respectively denotes the vector 
Infected classes with \ac{DENV-1}
and \ac{DENV-2}.
\paragraph{Host disease dynamics}
 Susceptible individuals ($S$) become infected for the first time with DENV-1 or DENV-2 after 
 a successful mosquito bite and move to classes $I_1$ and $I_2$, respectively. From here, they remain in the infected class for $1/\alpha_c$ time units, after which, move to a recovered class $R_S$.  As we are interested in a one year dynamics, for the rest of the epidemic they become immune to any serotype. A second class of susceptible individuals $S_{-1}$, consist on those who acquired DENV-1 in previous years and in the current year are susceptible only to DENV-2. Such individuals become infected with DENV-2 when exposed to infected mosquitoes with that serotype. In \cite{OhAinle2011} and \cite{Sangkawibha1984} it was observed that a more severe version of dengue occurs (might occur?) when an individual acquires dengue for a second time, and this happens to be DENV-2. Based on this assumption, an individual from $S_{-1}$ moves to $Y_{-1}^{[c]}$ or $Y_{-1}^{[h]}$, if the infection leads to DF or DHF, respectively. Finally, these infected individuals move to the recovered class $R_{S_{-1}}$ at rates $\alpha_c$ and $\alpha_h$, respectively. For our model, $\mu_H$ is the human death rate; $b$ is the number of bites per week per mosquito and $\beta_H$ is the effectiveness of the bite. From the current hypothesis our model is given by    

%Assuming sufficient density of vectors, we 
%describe the \ac{DCF} and \ac{DHF},
%using a cross infection mechanism similar to the 
%reported in \cite{Feng1997a}. 
%Our version allows a hemorrhagic description of 
%the Infected human population 
%with serotype $i$---see 
%\Cref{tbl:variable_description,tbl:parameter_description}
%to variable and parameter description. The symbol 
%$I_{i}$ represents the human infected 
%pupulation with serotype $i$,
%which never was infected before, while 
%$Y_{-i}^{[\star]}$ denotes the 
%number of humans which are immune to serotype 
%$i$ at the time of the 
%present outbreak and develops dengue of type 
%$\star$ (DCF or DHF).
%Then $S_{-i}$ are the individuals who were 
%infected with serotype $i$ in the 
%previous outbreak, and at the current time, are 
%susceptible only to a serotype different of $i$.

\end{equation}
Here, we take $N_H=N_S+N_{S_{-1}}$ as the total number of individuals. For our formulation $N_H, N_S$ and $N_{S_{-1}}$ remain constant. $N_S$ is the total number of individuals that are involved in the first infection dynamics ($N_S = S +I_1+I_2+R_S$). On the other hand $N_{S_{-1}}$ is the total number of individuals involved in the reinfection dynamics ($N_{S_{-1}}=S_{-1}+Y_1^{[c]}+ Y_1^{[h]}+R_{S_1}$). Also, the recovered individuals in both classes can be considered as a single recovered class $R=R_S+R_{S_{-1}}$ as our dynamics are taken only for one year. Then, our equations become

\todo{get a relation for the initial grow phase parameter}
Using the next generation operator method 
reported as in \cite{Feng1997a}, we obtain
the basic reproductive number
%\begin{equation}
%	\begin{aligned}
%		\pi_R & :=
%			\frac{\beta_H \beta_M b^2 \Lambda_M}{
%				\mu_M ^ 2  N_H ^ 2 
%		}
%	\\
%		R_{01} & := 
%			\pi_R
%			\left(
%				\frac{N_H - N_{S_{-1}}}{ \alpha_c + \mu_H}
%				+
%				\frac{(1- \theta ) \sigma N_{S_{-1}}}{ \alpha_c + \mu_H}
%			\right)
%		\\
%		R_{02}& :=
%			\pi_R
%				\frac{
%					\sigma \theta N_{S_{-1}}
%				}{\alpha_h + \mu_H},
%\qquad
%	\\
%	\mathcal{R}_0 & :=
%			\sqrt{ R_{01}+R_{02} }.
%	\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\psi &:= \frac{\beta_MbN_M}{\mu_MN_H}
		\\
		R_{0c} & := \sqrt{
			\psi
			\left(
				\frac{\beta_HbN_S}{ (\alpha_c + \mu_H)N_H}
				+
				\frac{\beta_Hb(1- \theta ) \sigma N_{S_{-1}}}{ (\alpha_c + \mu_H)N_H}
			\right)}
		\\
		R_{0h}& :=\sqrt{
			\left(\frac{\beta_MbN_M}{\mu_MN_H}\right)
				\left(\frac{
					\sigma \theta N_{S_{-1}}
				}{(\alpha_h + \mu_H)N_H}\right)}
%		\qquad
	\\
	\mathcal{R}_0 & :=
			\sqrt{ R_{0c}^2+R_{0h}^2 }.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

	In this equation, $R_{0c}$ and $R_{0h}$, are the basic reproductive numbers 
for classical and hemorrhagic dengue cases, respectively. From here, $R_0$ 
provides a measure of how DF and DHF infected people influence the presence of 
new dengue cases (Either DF or DHF). $R_{0h}$ measures the new hemorrhagic 
cases that arise from one hemorrhagic infected individual in a population of 
$N_{S_{-1}}$ susceptible to strain 2 individuals, meanwhile $R_{oc}$ provides a 
measure of how many new individuals will obtain DC fever (DF?) from an individual 
that has or has not have acquired dengue previously (from an individual that has either
DF or DHF).

	Observe that this $R_0$ differs in some way to the traditional $R_0$ where two
different serotypes are involved (\cite{Feng1997a} include citations of $R_0$ for two serotypes).
This follows from the idea that we are interested in classic and hemorrhagic
cases rather than the predominance of a serotype.
